title: MVC in a context
---

Everyone know MVC, but not everyone agress with the seperation of the concerns.

Q: Is the view on the server or lived in browser?
Q: Is the view reusable?
Q: Should the view be annotated with application-specific tags or markup?
Q: Where should the bulk of the business logic reside? (in the model? in the controller?)
Q: How is the application state persisted or accessed?


Traditional MVC
===
```                            
            User Interfaction          
                   |              
              +----v---+          
         +----+  View  <-----+    
 pass on |    +--------+     |Fires events    
         |                   |    
    +----v----+         +----+---+
    |control  +---------> Model  |
    +---------+ update  +--------+
```
This model assume a long-lived and swappable controller. it don't care how view is rendered(b/c events). backbone.js


Model2
===

```
          request|   ^full-renderd http response
                 |   |           
              +--v---+-+          
         +----+ control|-----+    
   update|    +--------+     |pass on/render
         |                   |    
    +----v----+         +----v---+
    | model   |         |  view  |
    +---------+         +--------+
```
view is on server side, and client browser is think. Java server & RoR using it.
the good thing about this layout is "fat models and thin controller", controller is more like a dispatcher. because HTTP is stateless, the decision is made on Session cookies.

MVP and MVVM
===
Model-View-Presenter and Model-View-ViewModel are similar to MVC, but
* View don't have direct reference to the Model
* view is thin
* Presenter/ViewModel has a reference to the view and update it based on changes to model

```
            User Interfaction          
                   |              
              +----v---+          
       +------+  View  |    
pass on|   +->+--------+     
       |   |update
       |   |                  
    +--v---+--+ manipulate +----+---+
    |presenter+----------->| Model  |
    |         <------------|        |
    +---------+   events   +--------+
```


MVVM assume that changes in ViewModel will refelcted in the View by data-binding, both way
Angular, Ember.


Events
===
* On HashedChanged or pushState events: occur when URL in the browser changes
* DOM events: for example: clicking a tag
