Built a distributed machine learning feature platform leveraging key AWS services. Demonstrating proficiency in designing scalable and cost-effective AWS architectures


 on AWS using Apache Airflow, Spark.

Designed and implemented the compute and storage layer to manage feature engineering infrastructure, incorporating automated ingest and serving

Led the standardization and migration of complex data pipeline infrastructure as code, resulting in significant improvements in security measures and workload isolation

Prepared, evaluated, and implemented operational excellence practices, including auto fail-over, recovery mechanisms, regional isolation strategies, and integration of chaos engineering experiments

Established continuous monitoring for AWS infrastructure and application performance. Analyzed and visualized key metrics, integrating alerts with third-party tools like Splunk, New Relic, Slack, and PagerDuty

Conducted root cause analysis for production incidents. Continuously enhanced platform resilience through the implementation of auto-remediate tools and dashboards. Updated runbook to improve the team's preparedness and responsiveness

Identified optimization opportunities for cluster configuration, leading to a 0.4% reduction in Spark cluster running costs



led the design of new service by align and concensus amount cross-functional teams. solify the API and message contract for all buisness requirement.
