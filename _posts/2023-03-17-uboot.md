issue when using airflow

***file access is slow when using cloud storage***

airflow keep scanning dags folder for representation of the airflow.
those files must be scanned often in order to mantain consistency between the on-disk source of truth for each workload and its in-database representation
this means the contents of the DAG directory must be consistent across all schedulers and workers in a single environment






***秒杀***
