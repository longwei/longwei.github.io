pick central time == central coordinator
decentralized time = Truetime/HLC

Borg、Omega and Kubernetes

Borg manage long-running services and batch jobs
core a shared persistent store via API (k8s, applies higher-level versioning, validation, semantics, and policy, in support of a more diverse array of clients)

container:
the first container just isolation of root file system, jail of namespaces => cgroups
resource isolation gives better utilzation.
mordern container = isolation mechanism + image.
docker daemon and docker image registry.

application oriented infra
data center from machine to app-oriented.

note from ma
最近的趋势是heterogenous HW
计算迭代很快，存贮比较慢。现在网络好，计算和存贮分离也可以接受

Data Center Topology
tor top of rack switch, L2 switch, 
multi-layer of router

管理数据中心的machine. 

screenshot of the cluster definalities

how is cluster management different?
HA
Scalable
Fault Tolerance
Distributed
Entities to manage

What's native service?
CNCF
Fault tolerance, Multi-tenancy, container based, namedspace, declare resource demand

Borg/Autopilot/Kubernetes


Pod Disruption Budget
Stateful info should be written to Spanner / BigTable etc.

Priority
check Borg.

Quota:
resource reservation
part of admission control

service discovery
Name


workload failure detection
liveness probe
